This program allows the user to input bits of media they've experienced all in one place.

2 asks for a previously inputted entry, which when inputted, marks that that piece of 
media has been finished
3 shows the user every entry added in order of oldest to newest
4 allows the user to write a review on any bit of media they like
5 allows the user to search for previously written reviews by name to reread them
6 saves any recommendations you may receive from friends or family
7 allows you to look at all of your saved recommendations
8 removes any recommendations already on the list, saving space for only the ones you have yet to experience.
